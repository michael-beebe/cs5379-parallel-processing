## Required Software
- MPI implementation (we are using Open MPI)
- C Compiler (such as gcc or clang)
- Make
- Bash

## Instructions
### Compile
To change the MPI wrapper to something other than `mpicc` (such as `mpich`), edit line 1 of the Makefile.
```
make
```

### Run
```
./run.sh
```
If you get an error saying "permission denied", run
```
chmod +x run.sh
```
then rerun `./run.sh`

### Clean Build
```
make clean
```

## Code Breakdown
### myBarrier():
- Synchronizes all participating processors.
- The synchronization is achieved in two main phases, each running for `log2(p_number)` iterations, where `p_number` is the total number of processors:
- Reducing Phase:
  - Starts with the highest power of 2 less than `p_number` and decrements in each iteration.
  - In each iteration, processors send notification messages to other processors based on their rank and the current power of 2.
- Scattering Phase:
  - Starts from the lowest power of 2 and increments in each iteration.
  - Similar to the reducing phase, processors send and receive notification messages based on their rank and the current power of 2.
- The use of `log2(p_number)` iterations ensures efficient synchronization, as each processor communicates directly with another processor in each step, reducing the total number of steps needed for all processors to synchronize.

### main():
- Initializes the MPI environment.
- Retrieves and prints information about the current processor.
- Calls the `myBarrier()` function to synchronize all processors.
- Finalizes the MPI environment.
