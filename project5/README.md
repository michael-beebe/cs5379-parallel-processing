In my program, load balancing achieved by the following equation in order to distribute the rows equally between the processes:
Part 1: 
Row location = (current iteration * (#processes * 2)) + myRank 
Part 2: 
Row location = ((current iteration+1) * (#processes * 2) -1) - myRank 
Theses equations will distribute the rows as the following (if we assume P=4 and N=32), please note the data in the table is the row number:
