## Required Software
- MPI implementation (we are using Open MPI)
- C Compiler (such as gcc or clang)
- Make
- Bash

## Instructions
### Compile
To change the MPI wrapper to something other than `mpicc` (such as `mpich`), edit line 1 of the Makefile.
```
make
```

### Run
```
./run.sh <desired number of processes>
```
The default number of processes is 4. You can change this by passing a command line argument when executing `run.sh`.

If you get an error saying "permission denied", run
```
chmod +x run.sh
```
then rerun `./run.sh`

### Clean Build
```
make clean
```

## Code Breakdown

The provided code is designed for parallel processing using MPI (Message Passing Interface) to calculate forces in a particle system. Here's a breakdown of its main components and functionality:

### Main Function (`main`)
- **MPI Initialization**: Initializes the MPI environment, necessary for any MPI program.
- **Process Information Retrieval**: Retrieves the total number of processes (`P`) and the rank of the current process (`myRank`).
- **Particle Initialization**: Allocates memory for and initializes an array of particles (`particles`) with unique values, done only by the process with rank 0.
- **Broadcasting Particles**: The master process (rank 0) broadcasts the initialized particle array to all other processes in the MPI world.
- **Barrier Synchronization**: Ensures all processes have received the particle data before proceeding.
- **Force Calculation Call**: Calls the `force_calc` function to compute forces on each particle.
- **MPI Finalization**: Cleans up the MPI environment at the end of the program.

### Force Calculation Function (`force_calc`)
- **Initial Setup**: Allocates a buffer for force values and initializes force array `f` with zeros.
- **Iteration Logic**: Uses a nested loop structure to iterate over particle pairs. The iteration is divided into parts based on the process rank and the number of processes (`P`).
  - **Determining Row Location**: Calculates the row location for force calculation based on the current process rank and iteration.
  - **Force Calculation**: Computes the force exerted on each particle by other particles. The calculation considers the difference in positions (`diff`) and updates forces for each pair.
- **Aggregation of Results**: Uses `MPI_Reduce` to gather computed forces from all processes to the master process.
- **Result Printing**: The master process prints the final aggregated force values.

### Overall Workflow and Parallelism
- The main function sets up the MPI environment and distributes particle data across all processes.
- The `force_calc` function performs the core computation, leveraging parallel processing to calculate forces. Each process handles a subset of the data, contributing to the overall computation.
- The program demonstrates efficient parallel computation by dividing the workload and using MPI functions for data distribution and result aggregation.

This code is a typical example of parallel computing applications where a large problem (force calculation in a particle system) is broken down into smaller parts, each handled by different processors in a distributed system.
